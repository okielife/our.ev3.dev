This folder contains robot-specific code.
It should contain a folder for each robot.
Each robot should have pictures, design details, sensor information, motor information, etc.

At some point, we might design a robot base class that all robot classes inherit from for convenience.
It could force the design of the functions to give us lots of details automagically.
